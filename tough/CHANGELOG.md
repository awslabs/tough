[#330]: https://github.com/awslabs/tough/pull/330

## [0.10.0] - 2020-01-14

[#256]: https://github.com/awslabs/tough/pull/256
[#308]: https://github.com/awslabs/tough/pull/308

## [0.9.0] - 2020-07-20
### Breaking Changes
- `RepositoryEditor` requires lifetime and `Transport` type parameters
- Minor breaking changes across the `editor` module to support delegated targets

### Added
- The `editor` module now supports delegated targets

### Changed
- `RepositoryEditor` ensures the root has enough keys to fulfill the signing threshold
- `RepositoryEditor` allows adding multiple signatures at once
- Added a `add_old_signatures` method to `SignedRole` to enable cross-signing from an old root role

## [0.8.0] - 2020-07-20
### Breaking Changes
- The `HttpTransport` type and the `Read` and `Error` types that it uses have changed.
- Remove `root.json` from Snapshot metadata per [theupdateframework/specification#40](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/pull/40)

### Added
- Added HTTP retry logic.
- Added early support for delegations.
- Added logging.
- Added documentation to all remaining items.
- Allow control of link/copy behavior for existing paths.

### Changed
- Dependency updates.
- Fix new clippy lints in Rust 1.45.

## [0.7.1] - 2020-07-09

### Security
- Fixed uniqueness verification of signature threshold. ([CVE-2020-15093](https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-5q2r-92f9-4m49))

## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-26

### Added
- Added `#[non_exhaustive]` to `tough::Error` and `tough::schema::Error`
- `editor::signed::SignedRepository`:
  - Added `copy_targets`, which does the same as `link_targets` except copies rather than symlinks
  - Added `link_target` and `copy_target`, which are used by the above functions and allow for handling single files with custom filenames

## [0.6.0] - 2020-06-11

### Added
- Added `Target::from_path()` method.
- Added the `KeySource` trait, which allows users to fetch signing keys.
- Added `RepositoryEditor`, which allow users to update a `tough::Repository`'s metadata and optionally add targets.

### Changed
- Dependency updates.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-05-18

For changes that require modification of calling code see #120 and #121.

### Added
- Add optional ability to load an expired repository.

### Changed
- Rename `target_base_url` to `targets_base_url`.
- Dependency updates.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-02-11
- Updated `reqwest` to `0.10.1` to fix an issue with https failures. Note this requires use of `reqwest::blocking::*` instead of `reqwest::*` in code that is using HttpTransport.
- Update all dependencies with `cargo update`.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-12-16
### Added
- Added the `Sign` trait to `tough`, which allows users to sign data.
- Added the `canonical_form` method to the `Role` trait, which serializes the role into canonical JSON.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-12-04
### Added
- New methods `root`, `snapshot`, and `timestamp` on `Repository` to access the signed roles.

### Changed
- Changed the return type of `Repository::targets` to the signed role (`Signed<Targets>`). The top-level `Target` type is no longer necessary. **This is a breaking change.**
- Updated snafu to v0.6. **This is a breaking change** to the `snafu::ErrorCompat` implementation on library error types.
- Updated pem to v0.7.
- Switched to using `ring::digest` for SHA-256 digest calculation.
- Added `Debug`, `Clone`, and `Copy` implementations to structs when appropriate.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-11-08

- Everything!
